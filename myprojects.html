      The Slider is a very simple game involving a sliding square controlled by the player. However, this is no ordinary sliding-block game;
      sometimes, the game will build itself to be too difficult, and in which case, the player can "reload" the level layout!<br>
      This game is still in its early stages and may continue to receive updates in the future.

      A simple animation of a chat I had with a friend about a Computer Science assignment. Enjoy!
