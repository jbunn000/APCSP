            I'm what's known as a traceur, as well as a writer (I might be a         <br>
            published author before the end of High School), and also a part-time    <br>
            Web Developer.  I love programming, and I regret not joining eAchieve    <br>
            earlier since I can't do everything I want to do before I graduate. I    <br>
            like to put things in my programs to make them unique, buuuuut...        <br>
            sometimes that comes at the cost of a PROF ;)                            <br>
